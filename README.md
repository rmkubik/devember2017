[Rules](http://devember.org/rules)

I, Ryan Kubik, will participate to the next Devember. My Devember will be to practice advanced JavaScript and learn React. I promise I will program for my Devember for at least an hour, every day of the next December. I will also write a daily public devlog and will make the produced code publicly available on the internet. No matter what, I will keep my promise. 

I plan on doing [Ludum Dare 40](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/), [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), [Wizard Jam 6](https://itch.io/jam/wizard-jam-6), and learning React. Hopefully I'll actually get to deploy my React app, but might run out of time with all of the game jamming.
