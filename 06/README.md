# Devember 6th

## Phaser Lunch & Learn
Taking a break from Advent of Code. The challenges are still pretty intersting; however, on top of a full time job writing code you sometimes need a break! Instead, I'm working on a presentation of the [Phaser](https://phaser.io) HTML5 game development framework for work. Every couple weeks someone from the office presents on an interesting topic over our lunch break. They're generally personal/career development related but we've done stuff from home automation to time management skills. 

Over the next few days I'm planning to put together a holidays themed endless runner game with some Kenney.nl assets so I have a good example project for next week during the presentation.

Outline/plan so far
