# Devember 12th

## Phaser Runner - Lunch & Learn Demo Project

Today I mainly did a bunch of refactoring of the demo project. I moved code out of one big file and broke it up into several different files and classes. Additionally, I added some HTML elements to the web page that interact with the Phaser game to illustrate the power of leveraging HTML in game dev. Got some styles imported via the gulpfile from the boilerplate projoect. Finally, got the project deployed using Surge.
