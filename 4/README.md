# Devember 4th

## Advent of Code
I missed several of the Advent of Code challenges while working on Ludum Dare this past weekend (which you can read about in the previous few days posts) so today I'm going to try and catch up on as many of the challenges as I can! 

I ended up finishing [Day #2](./checksum.py) and [Day #4](./passphrase.js). I brushed up a little bit on Python and Node.js file I/O for these challenges, which was good. I think I'm nearing the solution on Day #3 with some modulos and divisors, but decided to move on for now. Hopefully I'll finish up #3 and #5 tomorrow to be back on track!
