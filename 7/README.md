# Devember 7th

## Firebase and React

Today I attended a Firebase meetup in town and learned that its even easier to get started than I thought. This was especially true under the guidance of someone who already knew what they were doing. I got a really simple anonymous chat app up and running in the hour I was there. I definitely recommend checking Firebase out if you're in need of a super simple back end set up for a front end app.
