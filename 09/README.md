# Devember 9th

## Mentorship Saturday - Local Tech Meetup

I didn't get to write too much code today, but I did end up talking a lot about React, React Native, the Chrome Dev Tools, Web Scraping, Web APIs, and Software related entrepreneurship. I learned a lot about cool thigs people in the area are doing and got a lot of inspiration to start shipping some products next year. 

## Phaser Runner - Lunch & Learn Demo Project

Only got around to writing a little bit of code on Phaser Runner today. The world is now correctly being infinitely generated at a varying height. The next step will be to get the world scrolling by and continually generating new terrain as the game progresses. After that, we'll add a controllable player and will have our MVP to demo on Wednesday.
