# Devember 8th

## Phaser Runner - Lunch & Learn Demo Project

I talked about my general lesson plan for my presentaiton on the Phaser framework on [day #6](https://github.com/rmkubik/devember2017/blob/master/6/README.md). The first piece of getting the actual presentation written up was to get a simple Phaser game to demo. I chose to build an endless runner game that I'm planning to use [Kenney.nl's holiday assets](http://kenney.nl/assets/holiday-pack-2016) to spruce up for the season. 

Today I got a boilerplate project spun up from [belohlavek's phaser-es6-boilerplate repository](https://github.com/belohlavek/phaser-es6-boilerplate). I then got a "hello world" set up going rendering some Kenney.nl assets onto the screen. You can check out the repo [here](https://github.com/rmkubik/phaser-runner).
